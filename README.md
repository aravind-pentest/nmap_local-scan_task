# Nmap Local Scan Task

## Objective
Perform a TCP SYN scan on the local network to discover open ports and understand network exposure as part of a cybersecurity internship task.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Nmap

## Steps Taken
1. Installed Nmap on Kali Linux.
2. Found local IP range (192.168.1.0/24) using `ifconfig`.
3. Ran TCP SYN scan on the local network using:
4. Analyzed scan results to identify active hosts and open ports.
5. Ran full port scan on own machine (192.168.1.55) to check for open services:
6. Documented findings and learned about network service exposure and port scanning techniques.

## Sample Results
- Only own machine responded on the network.
- No open TCP ports found during scans.

## Outcome
- Gained practical experience with Nmap and network reconnaissance.
- Understood the importance of port scanning for identifying potential vulnerabilities.
